# Pokemon Drinking Boardgame

## What is this

A personal project on learning basics of game and game engine development using Python 3 and PyGame. My main focus in this project is to learn what kinds of design patterns are used in development of games and game engines, and how they affect the quality of the code.

Materials used in learning process include:
1. [Gaming Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
2. [Writing Games by Shandy Brown](http://ezide.com/games/writing-games.html)

## Disclaimer

I do not own the Pokemon franchise (property of Nintendo) nor the [assets I'm using](pokemon/gui/assets/README.md). Only the code here is mine.

## Requirements

The game requires [PyGame](http://pygame.org/) 1.9.1 or newer, and Python 3.

## How to run

Using command line and Python 3.

```bash
$ cd path/to/pokemon-drinking-game
$ python -m pokemon.main
```
